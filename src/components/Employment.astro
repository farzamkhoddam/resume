        <strong>Fullstack Web Developer</strong>-<!-- -->Marabox.com.au

        + <!-- -->As a Full-Stack Web Developer, I had the exciting opportunity
        to be a part of the development of Marabox.com.au, an innovative
        Australian startup. Marabox is a pioneering platform that aims to
        simplify the immigration process to Australia by connecting individuals
        with specialized expertise, such as immigration agents and agencies. My
        role involved building the website from scratch, incorporating essential
        features like multi-language support and multi-theme options to enhance
        user experience and accessibility.
      </p><p>
        + <!-- -->For the frontend, I utilized Next.js, a powerful and scalable
        framework, to create a responsive and dynamic user interface. Leveraging
        my proficiency in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I crafted an intuitive and
        visually appealing design that engaged users and facilitated seamless
        navigation throughout the platform.
      </p><p>
        + <!-- -->On the backend, I implemented Nodejs , Sanity as a CMS
        (Content Management System), ensuring content organization and
        management were efficient and straightforward. My emphasis on
        scalability and clean code architecture meant that future developers
        could effortlessly continue my work, making the project highly
        sustainable and adaptable to future developments.
      </p><p>
        As the lead developer for Marabox, I was instrumental in bringing the
        company's vision to life. From the initial conceptualization to the
        final implementation, I was responsible for every aspect of the
        development. This included crafting a user-friendly and visually
        appealing interface, ensuring seamless navigation, and implementing
        features that met the evolving needs of our users. I faced the challenge
        of balancing creative design with efficient development, often working
        independently to meet tight deadlines. This experience honed my skills
        in prioritization, problem-solving, and independent decision-making.

        + <!-- -->My first foray into the world of professional development was
        a frontend internship at ytjobs.co, a platform designed to connect
        YouTubers with freelancers. I was tasked with building a dynamic news
        feed showcasing recent influencer-related news, which involved
        leveraging React.js to create a responsive and engaging user experience.
        I also played a key role in refactoring the homepage to its current
        layout, designing the landing page, and crafting the influencer
        homepage. Beyond the technical skills, I gained invaluable insights into
        the importance of effective communication and collaboration within a
        development team. Working alongside experienced programmers, I learned
        best practices for code organization, version control, and ensuring a
        smooth workflow.
